We now know that this modern-day change of lifestyle really takes its toll on our health. The BioCharger provides a combination of outside energy sources that replicates, optimizes, and amplifies nature’s energies that the modern human lacks in order to help restore strength, stamina, coordination, and mental clarity in a fast and completely non-invasive way',
        'Trusted among some of the world’s most successful athletes, wellness coaches, and motivational speakers, such as Rob Gronkowski, Bode Miller, and Tony Robbins, the BioCharger is a subtle energy platform that simultaneously generates four types of naturally occurring energies: Light, Voltage, Frequencies and Harmonics, and Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields. These four energy types are vital to our overall wellness and proper cellular health.',

        'Have you ever stopped to question what evokes the feelings of relaxation and wellness after spending time on the beach or hiking in the woods? The answer is more than just fresh air and sunshine; it lies in these energies. With the BioCharger you can bring that healing indoors:',
        'LIGHT– Not the light from the sun, but the light of element gases being manipulated by magnetic fields to the point of vibrating at the speed of light.',
        `FREQUENCIES AND HARMONICS – are generated through the 100-per-second lightning strikes occurring within our Earth’s atmosphere.
        PEMF – The Earth’s pulsed electromagnetic field is a guidance system for planes, birds, and bees, etc. It is a catalyst for every biochemical reaction that happens on Earth, and we could not live without it. For the same reason, individuals practice “Earthing” or “Grounding”; the BioCharger allows for an amplified and optimized transfer of electrons in and around your body.`,
        'VOLTAGE – occurs within our atmosphere from lightning strikes, cosmic rays, and solar flares. Voltage is vital to our everyday cellular process and is a regular aspect of our nutrition. Electrolytes like magnesium and potassium create electrical charges within the cell to open the cell membrane allowing for open pathways for detox and cell rejuvenation.',

        'There are an average of 100 lightning strikes per second within our Earth’s atmosphere. That equals over 8 million strikes per day. The BioCharger simulates the beneficial voltage, frequencies, and harmonics that are produced by these lightning strikes in just one BioCharger Session.',
        'The unprecedented technology in the BioCharger represents more than 25 years of research, development, and validation that builds upon more than 80 years of documented research by internationally acclaimed scientists and early energy healing pioneers such as Nikola Tesla, Georges Lakhovsky and Royal Rife. Jim Girard, the inventor of the BioCharger, was privileged to work with a Tesla protégé who educated him in legacy technologies. The BioCharger was created by converging these legacy technologies with the cutting-edge technologies of today.',

      title: 'How Should You Use the BioCharger?',

        `According to the manufacturer: “Many users report beneficial and remarkable results from sitting in front of the BioCharger unit for as little as 30 seconds to 4 minutes, once a day. We have observed 10 minutes per session to be generally sufficient to energize individuals. With regards to improving and optimizing athletic performance, clients report that in addition to the above regimen, use of the BioCharger unit for approximately 15 minutes on the day of an athletic event is very beneficial.”
      Most people feel very relaxed and tranquil during a session. It’s recommended to consider a single intention during a session generally focusing on overcoming whatever challenge you are facing. Then just sit back and enjoy the healing, centering benefits that both Mother Nature and, now, modern technology have to offer! An unlikely pairing? With BioCharger, it’s true.`,
